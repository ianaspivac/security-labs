The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

Note: Virtualization Based Security requires a 64-bit version of Windows with Secure Boot enabled, which in turn requires that Windows was installed with a UEFI BIOS configuration, not a Legacy BIOS configuration. In addition, if running Windows on a virtual machine, the hardware-assisted CPU virtualization feature (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) must be exposed by the host to the guest VM.

More information on system requirements for this feature can be found at Windows Defender Credential Guard Requirements (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs

Note #2: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using Azure IaaS VMs.




Rationale:

Kerberos, NTLM, and Credential manager isolate secrets by using virtualization-based security. Previous versions of Windows stored secrets in the Local Security Authority (LSA). Prior to Windows 10, the LSA stored secrets used by the operating system in its process memory. With Windows Defender Credential Guard enabled, the LSA process in the operating system talks to a new component called the isolated LSA process that stores and protects those secrets. Data stored by the isolated LSA process is protected using virtualization-based security and is not accessible to the rest of the operating system.

Rationale:

The primary purpose of Microsoft Defender Application Guard is to present a 'sandboxed container' for visiting untrusted websites. If the host clipboard is made available to Microsoft Defender Application Guard, a compromised Microsoft Defender Application Guard session will have access to its content, potentially exposing sensitive information to a malicious website or application. However, the risk is reduced if the Microsoft Defender Application Guard clipboard is made accessible to the host, and indeed that functionality may often be necessary from an operational standpoint.

Impact:

Microsoft Defender Application Guard sessions will not be able to access the host device's clipboard, however the host device will be able to access the Microsoft Defender Application Guard session clipboard."

Note #2: At time of publication, Microsoft Defender Application Guard in all currently released versions of Windows 10 does not yet support protection for Microsoft Office, only for Microsoft Edge. Therefore the additional available options of 2 and 3 in this setting are not yet valid.

Note #3: At time of publication, Microsoft Defender Application Guard in all currently released versions of Windows 10 does not yet support protection for Microsoft Office, only for Microsoft Edge. Therefore the additional available options of 2 and 3 in this setting are not yet valid.

Rationale:

Microsoft Defender Application Guard uses Windows Hypervisor to create a virtualized environment for apps that are configured to use virtualization-based security isolation. While in isolation, improper user interactions and app vulnerabilities can't compromise the kernel or any other apps running outside of the virtualized environment.

Impact:

Microsoft Defender Application Guard will be turned on for Microsoft Edge.
