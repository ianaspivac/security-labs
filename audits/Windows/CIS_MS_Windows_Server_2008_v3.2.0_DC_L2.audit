      info        : "This policy setting allows accounts to log on using the task scheduler service.

Because the task scheduler is often used for administrative purposes, it may be needed in enterprise environments.

However, its use should be restricted in high security environments to prevent misuse of system resources or to prevent attackers from using the right to launch malicious code after gaining user level access to a computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: 'Administrators'.

Rationale:
The Log on as a batch job user right presents a low-risk vulnerability.

For most organizations, the default settings are sufficient."
      solution    : "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 'Administrators':

Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment\Log on as a batch job

Impact:
If you configure the Log on as a batch job setting through domain-based Group Policies, the computer will not be able to assign the user right to accounts that are used for scheduled jobs in the Task Scheduler.

If you install optional components such as ASP.NET or IIS, you might need to assign this user right to additional accounts that are required by those components.

For example, IIS requires assignment of this user right to the 'IIS_WPG' group and the 'IUSR_'_(ComputerName)_, 'ASPNET', and 'IWAM_'_(ComputerName)_ accounts.

If this user right is not assigned to this group and these accounts, IIS will be unable to run some COM objects that are necessary for proper functionality."

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

Note: Changes to this setting will not take effect until Windows is restarted.

Rationale:

Passwords that are cached can be accessed by the user when logged on to the computer. Although this information may sound obvious, a problem can arise if the user unknowingly executes hostile code that reads the passwords and forwards them to another, unauthorized user."

Impact:

Credential Manager will not store passwords and credentials on the computer. Users will be forced to enter passwords whenever they log on to their Passport account or other network resources that aren't accessible to their domain account. Testing has shown that clients running Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 will be unable to connect to Distributed File System (DFS) shares in untrusted domains. Enabling this setting also makes it impossible to specify alternate credentials for scheduled tasks, this can cause a variety of problems. For example, some third party backup products will no longer work. This policy setting should have no impact on users who access network resources that are configured to allow access with their Active Directory-based domain account.

Default Value:

Disabled. (Credential Manager will store passwords and credentials on the computer for later use for domain authentication.)"

      info        : "Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a set of protocols that computers use to exchange information over the Internet and over home and business networks. IPv6 allows for many more IP addresses to be assigned than IPv4 did. Older networking, hosts and operating systems may not support IPv6 natively.

The recommended state for this setting is: DisabledComponents - 0xff (255)

Rationale:

Since the vast majority of private enterprise managed networks have no need to utilize IPv6 (because they have access to private IPv4 addressing), disabling IPv6 components removes a possible attack surface that is also harder to monitor the traffic on. As a result, we recommend configuring IPv6 to a Disabled state when it is not needed."
      solution    : "To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Registry value to 0xff (255) (DWORD):

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TCPIP6\Parameters:DisabledComponents

Note: This change does not take effect until the computer has been restarted.
Note #2: Although Microsoft does not provide an ADMX template to configure this registry value, a custom .ADM template (Disable-IPv6-Components-KB929852.adm) is provided in the CIS Benchmark Remediation Kit to facilitate its configuration. Be aware though that simply turning off the group policy setting in the .ADM template will not 'undo' the change once applied. Instead, the opposite setting must be applied to change the registry value to the opposite state.

Impact:

Connectivity to other systems using IPv6 will no longer operate, and software that depends on IPv6 will cease to function. Examples of Microsoft applications that may use IPv6 include: Remote Assistance, HomeGroup, DirectAccess, Windows Mail.

This registry change is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 929852: How to disable IPv6 or its components in Windows.

Note: This registry change does not take effect until the next reboot.

Default Value:

All IPv6 components are enabled and Windows prefers IPv6 over IPv4."

      info        : "This policy setting allows you to join Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS), which Microsoft has now renamed to 'Windows Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service'.

Microsoft MAPS / Windows Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service is the online community that helps you choose how to respond to potential threats.

The community also helps stop the spread of new malicious software infections.

You can choose to send basic or additional information about detected software.

Additional information helps Microsoft create new definitions and help it to protect your computer.

Possible options are:

- (0x0) Disabled (default)
- (0x1) Basic membership
- (0x2) Advanced membership

Basic membership will send basic information to Microsoft about software that has been detected including where the software came from the actions that you apply or that are applied automatically and whether the actions were successful.

Advanced membership in addition to basic information will send more information to Microsoft about malicious software spyware and potentially unwanted software including the location of the software file names how the software operates and how it has impacted your computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: 'Disabled'.

Rationale:
The information that would be sent can include things like location of detected items on your computer if harmful software was removed.

The information would be automatically collected and sent.

In some instances personal information might unintentionally be sent to Microsoft.

However, Microsoft states that it will not use this information to identify you or contact you.

For privacy reasons in high security environments, it is best to prevent these data submissions altogether."
